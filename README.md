#Unity - Survival Shooter Game
This is a simple Unity game that I made while taking the [Introduction to Game Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-development) course.

In order to run the game, clone this repository, unzip the compressed file and open index.html

(Sorry, but I had to do this because the uncompressed file was > 100 MB, which GitHub doesn't support)
